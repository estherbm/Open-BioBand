# Open-BioBand

    Open BioBand is a biometric Open Source wristband with BLE (Bluetooth
    Low Energy) connectivity used to non-invasive monitorization of patients
    and their environment. It measure several parameters such as pulse, SPO2,
    body temperature, motion activity, pressure, humidity, temperature...

    It allow developers to investigate and learn about wearables and biometric 
    sensors and artists to create new biological performances and projects.
    
    Created as final thesis Industrial Engineering project.
